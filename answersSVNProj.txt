Question #1 "What are the differences between git and svn?"
Answer 
Git is a distributed VCS and SVN(subversion) is a centralized VCS
Git uses a peer-to-peer approach and holds a copy of the entire repository on the local machine whereas
svn uses a server/client approach and only stores a copy of the repository files (located on a server) in a working copy(directory) on the client(local machine). There are other differences as well.

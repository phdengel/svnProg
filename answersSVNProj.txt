Question #1 "What are the differences between git and svn?"
Answer 
Git is a distributed VCS and SVN(subversion) is a centralized VCS
Git uses a peer-to-peer approach and holds a copy of the entire repository on the local machine whereas
svn uses a server/client approach and only stores a copy of the repository files (located on a server) in a working copy(directory) on the client(local machine). There are other differences as well. 

Question #2 "How are commits handled in svn?"
Answer
the commit sends all changes made to files in the working copy on local machine to repository which is on the server

Question #3 "How are check outs performed in svn?"
Answer
My example I used this -->$ svn checkout https://github.com/phdengel/svnProg.git

Question #4 "How do you create the local working environment with svn (the .svn direc-
tory)?"
Answer
-> run svn import command to upload your directory/files to repository. # this places local files in respository and begin tracking changes under svn control.
-> run svn checkout # this gets you the working copy of repository files to start dev work on local machine changes now tracked by svn

Question #5 "How do you add files to the repository?"
Answer
After creating file in Working Copy(WC) -> run svn add <name of file> which only schedules file to be added torepository (this changes the ? to A in front of file when svn status is run)
Once add is completed -> run svn commit <name of file> -m "log message" (log message using -m switch) which commits file to repository.

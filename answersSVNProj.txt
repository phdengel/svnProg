Question #1 "What are the differences between git and svn?"
Answer 
Git is a distributed VCS and SVN(subversion) is a centralized VCS
Git uses a peer-to-peer approach and holds a copy of the entire repository on the local machine whereas
svn uses a server/client approach and only stores a copy of the repository files (located on a server) in a working copy(directory) on the client(local machine). There are other differences as well. 

Question #2 "How are commits handled in svn?"
Answer
the commit sends all changes made to files in the working copy on local machine to repository which is on the server

Question #3 "How are check outs performed in svn?"
Answer
My example I used this -->$ svn checkout https://github.com/phdengel/svnProg.git

Question #4 "How do you create the local working environment with svn (the .svn direc-
tory)?"
Answer
-> run svn import command to upload your directory/files to repository. # this places local files in respository and begin tracking changes under svn control.
-> run svn checkout # this gets you the working copy of repository files to start dev work on local machine changes now tracked by svn

Question #5 "How do you add files to the repository?"
Answer
After creating file in Working Copy(WC) -> run svn add <name of file> which only schedules file to be added torepository (this changes the ? to A in front of file when svn status is run)
Once add is completed -> run svn commit <name of file> -m "log message" (log message using -m switch) which commits file to repository.

Question #6 "How are branches handled in svn?"
Answer
a branch is a segregated copy of a project tree (ex: trunk/svnptroj)
Copying this directory should be completed on the server, this is a constant-time operation, and it's
the way most people create branches. 
You now can checkout a new working copy to begin working with it.

Question #7 "How many branches can you have at any given time?"
Answer
Unlimited number of branches are allowed

Question #8 "What does your local copy of a repository look like with svn?"
Answer
It looks like any other directory structure on a local machine; full of files and subdirectories, etc.

Question #9 "How do you check the status of the les you are presently working on?"
svn status

Question #10 "How long are branches in svn supposed to exist?"
Answer
branches last until deleted; they will still be seen in earlier revisions when using svn checkout, svn switch or svn list.
